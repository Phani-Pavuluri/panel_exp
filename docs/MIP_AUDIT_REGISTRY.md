## Program summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Assess whether implemented work, roadmap direction, scientific rigor, architecture, and governance remain aligned to the MIP north star |
| **Cadence** | After every major milestone; before production-promotion decisions |
| **Success criterion** | No untracked gaps, orphan findings, unsupported methods, or roadmap drift |

## AUDIT-001 summary (B5c + B5d + alignment gate)

**Scope:** Track B contract discipline through B5d; research lane added to alignment gate.

**Strengths**

1. Fixture-oracle pipeline is executable: composer (B5c) + validator (B5d) + F1–F12 guards.  
2. Trust boundary is test-proven: verdicts only on TrustReport scenarios.  
3. Research lane prevents the gate from blocking Track D while keeping promotion strict.

**Risks**

1. **Fixture–production gap:** Golden slices are authoritative; real GeoX RunBundle dual-write was not yet on mainline at audit time.  
2. **Statistical claims still pre-D1:** Contracts prevent semantic lies; OC/math audits not yet executed.  
3. **Component illusion:** Rich docs/fixtures can feel “done” without product path.

**Missing pieces**

1. M2 dual-write committed and audited (→ AUDIT-002).  
2. `resolve_adapter_output` on production export paths (not only fixture slice).  
3. Track D D1+ under research lane after M2.

**Verdict:** `continue_with_minor_corrections` — stay on production path B5 → M2 → adapter wire-up; keep Track D in research lane.

**Full report:** Use template sections 1–11 when copying to `docs/audits/AUDIT-001_b5_alignment_gate.md` for archival detail.

## AUDIT-002 summary (M2 dual-write)

**Report:** [`audits/AUDIT-002_m2_dual_write.md`](audits/AUDIT-002_m2_dual_write.md)

**Verdict:** `continue_with_minor_corrections` — M2 alignment gate stop conditions **met** (313 tests; 14/14 live adapter oracle; legacy bundle schema stable; opt-in sidecar).

**Confirmed**

1. Legacy RunBundle unchanged when `include_track_b_views=False`.  
2. `track_b_views` sidecar-only; no legacy key replacement.  
3. No `alignment_verdict` / `trust_outcome` on adapter or evidence layers.  
4. Unmapped `config_alias` → `export_status: blocked` (no ID guessing).

**Remaining gaps (explicit)**

1. Production TrustReport path not wired.  
2. Track D D1+ robustness audits not started (research lane; do not skip).  
3. Bundle metadata extraction from all real GeoX runs not yet proven.

**Next production-lane item:** M2.2 production TrustReport path (AUDIT-003 gate passed).

## AUDIT-003 summary (M2.1 wire-up gate)

**Report:** [`audits/AUDIT-003_m2_1_wire_up_gate.md`](audits/AUDIT-003_m2_1_wire_up_gate.md)

**Verdict:** `continue_with_minor_corrections` — **gate passed**; M2.1 meets AUDIT-002 follow-up.

**Confirmed**

1. Five representative RunBundles (REP-001–005): complete, blocked, partial explicit.  
2. `extract_resolve_input_from_bundle` — no estimand-from-estimator guess; cataloged `estimator+inference_mode` only.  
3. Legacy `build_run_artifact_bundle` default unchanged (`include_track_b_views=False`).  
4. No `alignment_verdict` / `trust_outcome` on adapter or evidence (REP + B5 boundary).  
5. Production TrustReport deferred (M2.2 next); Track D D1+ not started (eligible research-lane parallel).

**Post-gate decision**

| Path | Status |
|------|--------|
| **M2.2** production TrustReport | **Recommended next** (production lane) |
| **Track D D1** | Allowed in parallel (research lane only) |
| **More M2.1 hardening** | Only on new live GeoX shape failures |

## How to add an audit

1. Copy [`MIP_PERIODIC_ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROBUSTNESS_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md`](MIP_PERIODIC_ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROBUSTNESS_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md).  
2. Fill all sections; do not skip §9 gap discovery.  
3. Add a row to the index table above.  
4. Set status `closed` when follow-ups are ticketed or merged into roadmap.
