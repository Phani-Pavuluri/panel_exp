## Program summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Assess whether implemented work, roadmap direction, scientific rigor, architecture, and governance remain aligned to the MIP north star |
| **Cadence** | After every major milestone; before production-promotion decisions |
| **Success criterion** | No untracked gaps, orphan findings, unsupported methods, or roadmap drift |

## AUDIT-001 summary (B5c + B5d + alignment gate)

**Scope:** Track B contract discipline through B5d; research lane added to alignment gate.

**Strengths**

1. Fixture-oracle pipeline is executable: composer (B5c) + validator (B5d) + F1–F12 guards.  
2. Trust boundary is test-proven: verdicts only on TrustReport scenarios.  
3. Research lane prevents the gate from blocking Track D while keeping promotion strict.

**Risks**

1. **Fixture–production gap:** Golden slices are authoritative; real GeoX RunBundle dual-write was not yet on mainline at audit time.  
2. **Statistical claims still pre-D1:** Contracts prevent semantic lies; OC/math audits not yet executed.  
3. **Component illusion:** Rich docs/fixtures can feel “done” without product path.

**Missing pieces**

1. M2 dual-write committed and audited (→ AUDIT-002).  
2. `resolve_adapter_output` on production export paths (not only fixture slice).  
3. Track D D1+ under research lane after M2.

**Verdict:** `continue_with_minor_corrections` — stay on production path B5 → M2 → adapter wire-up; keep Track D in research lane.

**Full report:** Use template sections 1–11 when copying to `docs/audits/AUDIT-001_b5_alignment_gate.md` for archival detail.

## How to add an audit

1. Copy [`MIP_PERIODIC_ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROBUSTNESS_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md`](MIP_PERIODIC_ARCHITECTURE_AND_ROBUSTNESS_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md).  
2. Fill all sections; do not skip §9 gap discovery.  
3. Add a row to the index table above.  
4. Set status `closed` when follow-ups are ticketed or merged into roadmap.
